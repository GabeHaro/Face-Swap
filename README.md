# Face-Swap

Openframeworks program that can track faces using the dLib library (Boost Software License 1.0) algorithm and can swap two faces in real time. 

Requires ofxOpenCv, ofxCv, and ofxDLib (MIT License)

Impotant note: int the FaceTrackerNew folder, there are two files to replace FaceTracker.h and Facetracker .cpp in ofxDLib/src/ o as to allow scaling to increase the speed of face tracking.

Included face cloning code based on the work of Arturo Castro and Kyle McDonald (MIT License) https://github.com/arturoc/FaceSubstitution
